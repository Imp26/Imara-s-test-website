## Occupation
Research Professor <br> Department of Plant and Microbial Biology <br> North Carolina State University
## Background 
 The overarching goal of my research is to understand the molecular mechanisms governing plant responses to environmental stimuli and stress. Our current focus is on inositol pyrophosphates, a novel class of signaling molecules. Our hypothesis is that these molecules are involved in energy and nutrient sensing in plants and we are taking a multifaceted approach of molecular genetics, biochemistry, physiology, and systems biology to address this hypothesis as well as understand the global regulation of the pathway. <p> Another avenue of research in the lab is to characterize seedling responses to microgravity and the spaceflight environment. Plants will be an integral part of long distance space travel or habitation. An understanding of how plants respond to the spaceflight environment is an important step towards enabling them to withstand stresses and optimize their growth.
